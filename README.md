# AI Poetry
A simple AI poetry web application that can produce character-based poetry using [torch-rnn](https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn). The model is trained on public domain poetry texts from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Unfortunately the project is no longer online. For more information, please see this [blog post](https://medium.com/@uneeb/generating-poetry-using-recurrent-neural-networks-6a4fe7e3b3ac).
### Samples

The poems of hasted leave the self-ore then
The hands the band and barbarians, yet not the wind of the glass:
And late me all the boast of the way
More neighbour shall be in vain,
Who shrought in this works to be.
 
	Then should for the houses you are I would,
	The morn of your anger from his man,
	And I tell the matter down the power,
	But what he never known in vain her servile mountains might see
	To the knything with frostic for did so now leaves to further haue

'But the numbers of the worn and all his hand,
In the worm the blood of means of dreary ground,
Which in the sun of the solong glimmer and rage
                                                'Twas his flame.

The deep and should have save the worthy shore
To the rest and honour to the shore of the sight
...
And the chariotes of the world and morning blood,
And the spear and the sports of the streets of dreary course
And the steeds, and the great and the way
The while he realms the state and fair of the day.

### Notes
* The program is implemented using now deprecated libraries, including torch-rnn.
* As the project was relatively small, some environment variables are included within the source code.
