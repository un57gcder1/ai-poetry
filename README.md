# AI Poetry
A simple AI poetry web application that can produce character-based poetry using [torch-rnn](https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn). The model is trained on public domain poetry texts from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Unfortunately the project is no longer online. For more information, please see this [blog post](https://medium.com/@uneeb/generating-poetry-using-recurrent-neural-networks-6a4fe7e3b3ac).

The forest spells in this thou the winds
The world against thou works, and while thou art
Except the king of men even in the bands,
And with the wind of old horrors, reason,
The crimson--and to draw the destroy,
And good a blood mine on the land of the shores and pity

The whole land push, and fled, where the cloudly of earn,
  	The gloom and the last place the cloud to her blaze;
   	As he ends on his eyes to the least with the face,
      	On the fiery thought of the Monarl
      	The way did they want and black home.
      No sails be such and speech I think the ground.

Come of the old of the tempester                              	50
In him designs it is beneath the serpent,
The penning of the wing to convey,
Her high on the deep, and men to the sky.
The poems of hasted leave the self-ore then
The hands the band and barbarians, yet not the wind of the glass:
And late me all the boast of the way
More neighbour shall be in vain,
Who shrought in this works to be.
 
	Then should for the houses you are I would,
	The morn of your anger from his man,
	And I tell the matter down the power,
	But what he never known in vain her servile mountains might see
	To the knything with frostic for did so now leaves to further haue
	The thought a life in the liberty:
	Pretent of all the glorious Fortune,
	And how he said the human stream,
	To despair the guests and golden fate
	She stood in her poet dead in melody of them.

Oh the swelling subtle means of your might
Should see the western holds in the long dreams
The waters, and stand is made down did bearer,
And mix and the road, and in the face,
The side during shake himself of the work.

That while the stone of the subjects back
Usung in assisting still, dear a stow,
A cold did none be death his shore what words,
The band of song of the far of the blood,
But not so the storm with the cruel death,
When the skies, and the train and guilty rise.

THE AID BANK BOOK OF THE TOTTER THEN MOOD:
The hour of blood in thee will speak,
And shall I that confessing the triumph,
Art what how some inspirent motion of the forest.

'But the numbers of the worn and all his hand,
In the worm the blood of means of dreary ground,
Which in the sun of the solong glimmer and rage
                                                'Twas his flame.

The deep and should have save the worthy shore
To the rest and honour to the shore of the sight
Have not the ground with the spirit of the state,
And the chariotes of the world and morning blood,
And the spear and the sports of the streets of dreary course
And the steeds, and the great and the way
The while he realms the state and fair of the day.

### Notes
* The program is implemented using now deprecated libraries, including torch-rnn.
* As the project was relatively small, some environment variables are included within the source code.
